our little app from HackLBS2020 in its browser version... this is the demonstration version, i.e. identification of classes is fully working, while badges and map features are hard-coded (can you find all the easter-eggs ;))

install all the requirements: 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

run the program with streamlit:
`streamlit run teslaPigeon.py`

the first run downloads the necessary models ;)
