# notARobin
our little app from HackLBS2020 in its browser version...

## what
the team consisted of:
- Rhys Feeney (Idea generator and Financial Planning Analyst
- Claire Wu (Developer and Product Manager)
- Johanna Mader (Subject Expert and Designer)
- Matthias Pilz (Developer and Researcher)

This is the demonstration version, i.e. identification of classes is fully working, while badges and map features are hard-coded (can you find all the easter-eggs ;))

## how
Python version > 3.7 necessary!
install all the requirements: 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

run the program with streamlit:
`streamlit run teslaPigeon.py`

the first run downloads the necessary models ;)
